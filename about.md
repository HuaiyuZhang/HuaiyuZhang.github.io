My name is Huaiyu Zhang. As a modeler, my current job at Freddie Mac focuses on credit risk models. I received my PhD in Statistics from [Kansas State Univerity](https://www.k-state.edu/).

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

- Quantitative Analytics Senior @Freddie Mac. Mc Lean, VA, USA. Since 1/2020.

- Data Science Internship @Liberty Mutual Insurance Group. Boston, MA, USA. 6/2019-8/2019.


## EDUCATION

- Ph.D. in Statistics, Kansas State University, Department of Statistics. Manhattan, Kansas, USA. 12/2019.

- Bachelor and Master of Economics majoring in Statistics. Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, School of Statistics, Dalian, China. 2011, 2014.



## SELECTED PROJECTS

### Loan Cancellation Prediction. (April, 2019)

Led a team and won [first place](https://www.k-state.edu/stats/news/2019DataScienceContestWinners.html) among 32 teams in a modeling contest held by a commercial premium financing company. Built models (XGBoost + logistic regression) to predict the loan cancellations and served [online](https://datacats.shinyapps.io/ipfs/)  using R Shiny.

### Damage Localization in Disaster Assessment. (March, 2018)
Collaboratively designed a [weakly supervised approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07378v1.pdf) (VGG19 + Class Activation Mapping) to locate damage in a disaster image and to quantify the degree of the damage. The new approach enables the use of social network images for	post-disaster damage assessment and provides an inexpensive	and feasible alternative to the more costly GIS approach.
