title: Group testing
---
A common practice for laboratories testing procedure is pooling the specimens together and testing them as a group. Due to the low prevalence of the diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis C, finding negative result for a group means that all the samples in this group are negative (given the test has high specificity and sensitivity, which is usually the case). 

For example, suppose a blood donation center would like to screen 200 blood samples for HIV. Most direct way is to test them individually where the total number of tests is 200.  The group testing  procedure can split the 200 blood samples into 20 groups each having 10 samples. At the first stage, the number of tests is only 20, and that's all the tests if all groups declare negative. If any group declares positive, further tests can be done for them, either splitting into subgroups or test individually. Due to the low chance of positive samples, the number of tests in the group testing strategy will be reduced than the normal individual testing strategy.

What's the benefit? Lower costs in terms of money and time. 

Another concern is the configuration of this group testing: I have a bunch of samples, then how many groups should I split them into? Dr. Christopher Bilder did a lot of research in this area, including determining optimal group sizes. More details and extensions can be found in a series of his [research papers](http://www.chrisbilder.com/grouptesting/).
