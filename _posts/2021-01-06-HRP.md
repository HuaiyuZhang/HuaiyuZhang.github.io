title: [Paper Reading] Hierarchical Risk Parity Accounting for Tail Dependencies
---

## abstract

The paper investigates portfolio diversification based on hierachical clustering using graph theory and unsupervised machine learning. They focus on a measure based on the lower tail dependence coefficient to better capture the tail risk.

## Introduction

Traditional portfolio theory relies on Markowitz's mean-variance paradigm. Such optimization is very sensitive to expected return. This paper turns the focus to risk estimation instead of return forecasting.

This approach inherits Meucci(2009), who used PCA to identify risk drivers and make overall risk equally distribute across uncorrelated principal portfolios. Recent work by Lopez de Prado (2016) proposed to use hierarchical risk parity (HRP) to replace PCA.

HRP usually takes two steps: 1. hierarchical clustering algorithm finds a tree-based representation; 2. allocation strategy along the tree structure gives portfolio weights. Original HRP builds on correlation coefficient. To address the tail risk, this paper chooses the lower tail dependence coefficient.

## 1. HRP

Multi-asset: equity, bond, commodity, credit
Multi-factor: carry, value, momentum, quality, volatility.

Full estimation of correlation matrix is difficult. The Minimum Spanning Tree(MST) only focuses on important relationship (N-1 edges). It assembles the dendrogram for hierarchical clustering (single linkage).

Prado (2016) recursive bisection algorithm ignores the structure of clusters and only cares about the order at the bottom level

## 2. Tail dependence 

Construct a dissimilarity measure by $d(X, Y) = - log(\lambda_L) $ where

$$\lambda_L  = lim_{t\searrow 0}P(X\le F_X^{-1}(t) | F_Y^{-1}(t)) $$

is the lower tail dependence coefficient (LTDC). Practically, LTDC is usually estimated by copulas. LTDC measures the probability of concurrence of extreme values on the left tails.

## 3. Risk based allocation
- Equal weighted: concentrated risk if an asset has extreme risk
- Minimum variance: concentrate on low-risk assets
- Inverse volatility: naive; ignores the correlation

A true risk parity strategy mush satisfy $TRC_i = TRC_j$ for all asset i, j. It would go to an optimization problem.

For a factor model, the paper further adopts Meucci(2009) PCA method and Meucci, Santangelo, and Deguest (2015) minimum-torsion transformation method.
