title: Paper Reading--On the Physiology of Investment Biases
---

## Abstract
The underlying physiological mechanisms of biases are not well understood. As such, we examine the impact of **testosterone** and **cortisol** levels on several commonplace investment biases using realistic trading simulations. Cortisol, the biological marker of stress, is positively related to the *disposition effect* and *portfolio turnover*, which is consistent with the relation between judgment errors and stress in social settings. Testosterone, the male hormone, is also positively related to *portfolio turnover*, which is consistent with androgen-driven behaviors. Overall, the results show that the endocrine system plays a significant role during financial decision-making, that has important consequences for the financial industry.
