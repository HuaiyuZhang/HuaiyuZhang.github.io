1. Create a new repo called username.github.io

2. JekyII is automatically incorporated into github site. In the setting for the repo, there is a way of choosing the theme.

   >
   >  git add -A
   >
   >  git commit -m 'message'
   >
   >  git push -u origin master
   >
   >  git pull

3. Once the theme is chosen,  `_config.yml` will be shown in the repo. Edit  it with some information. For example

   ```yml
   highlighter: Randomania
   name: Huaiyu's website
   description: Collecting ideas in statistics
   url: "https://huaiyuzhang.github.io"

   markdown: kramdown
   theme: jekyll-theme-minimal #activate the theme
   ```

4. Now the website should be fine.
