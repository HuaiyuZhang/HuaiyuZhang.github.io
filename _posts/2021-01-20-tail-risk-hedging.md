title: Paper Reading--Tail risk hedging
---

## Introduction

- Direct tail hedges with long out-of-the-money(OTM) index put strategies. (Put)

- Indirect tail hedges with multi-asset class trend-following strategies. (Trend)

Empirical evidence supports the Trend following over Put.

## The long-term average return/cost of Put and Trend strategies.

The long-run excess return of Put is lower than Trend. Put did make timely gains in sharp bear markets but spent those gains soon after by buying more expensive puts. Option prices may embed "insurance" type premia. The prices imply volatilities and negative skewness, which tend to exceed subsequent realizations and market expectations. 

The data for over 35 years are large enough for the conclusion because this sample period was NOT exceptionally adverse to Put. The result is also robust regardless of the choice of maturity and moneyness.

**Economic rationale**: Long OTM puts are expensive because they provide a useful insurance service for typical portfolios. The negative equity market beta of long puts warranting a negative premium. Trend is a return seeking strategy with tail hedging being a useful by-product.

## How reliable and efficient is the hedge provided by Put and Trend in equity market tail events.

Empirical evidences show that in the worst drawdowns, both Put and Trend provides better hedging than Treasuries or gold. Put tends to outperform in short horizons (fast protection). Trend even earn positive return. This implies that many worst months don't come out of the blue but rather follow earlier trouble allowing Trend to adjust the position.

**Economic rationale**:
Option-based strategies often combine multiple option maturities and strikes. Trade-offs between reliability and both cost saving and convexity enhancement will sometimes lead to compromises in protection. Portfolio may not match the option underlying for hedging. Deep OTM puts provides extreme convexity but the flipside is most of them expire worthless. Large portfolio OTM options can be very costly.

## How impatience can make investor experience even worse

The high bleeding costs of the Put strategy make it less likely that investors will even achieve the long-run returns or tail rewards. Investors have a better chance of sticking with Trend.
