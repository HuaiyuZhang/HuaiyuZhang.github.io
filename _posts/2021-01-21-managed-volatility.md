title: Paper Reading--Learning from a decade of managed volatility
---


- Dynamic risk mitigation strategies seek to provide a capital-efficient way to generate higher risk-adjusted returns and reduced drawdowns without the most normally associated with left tail protection.

- Managed volatility continues to be a viable solution for many and performs comparably with other algorithms.

- Evaluating strategies should be based on longer horizon.


Managed volatility came to prominence following the financial crisis to help reduce portfolio drawdowns during equity bear markets.  
In the last decade, equity markets did not experienced a deep bear market. The strategies are designed to de-risk, but subsequent rapid rebounds erased any performance benefit. As such, the investors are not in favor of managed volatility. This paper reevaluates empirical evidences to show that the managed volatility is still a good strategy.

Three other risk mitigation strategies are compared: option replication, trend-following, blend. In the full historical sample, all genereated higher Sharpe and Calmar ratios than index. Post 2010, only managed volatility won the index in US. The reason is lack of large drawdowns post 2010. Dynamic strategy performed better in US than abroad. 

No single approach dominates; each strategy trades off return, stability of volatility, degree of downside risk mitigation and trading volume.
